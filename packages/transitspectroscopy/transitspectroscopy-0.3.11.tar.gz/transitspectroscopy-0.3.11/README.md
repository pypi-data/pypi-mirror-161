# TransitSpectroscopy ü™ê --- a package for all your transit spectroscopy needs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`transitspectroscopy` is a package containing algorithms and wrappers useful for performing transit (transmission and emission) spectroscopy of exoplanetary systems.

## Statement of need
I might fill this in later, but basically: I needed a package to make available all the tools useful for transit spectroscopy: from tracing, spectral extraction to actual lightcurve fitting of wavelength-dependant transits.

## Installation
Installation is as simple as:

        python setup.py install

Or via PyPi:

        pip install transitspectroscopy

## Licence and attribution

Read the `LICENCE` file for licencing details on how to use the code.
