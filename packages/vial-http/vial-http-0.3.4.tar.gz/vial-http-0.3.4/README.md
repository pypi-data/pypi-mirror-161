Vial
====

There are bzillion http frameworks for Python. This is yet another one.

Vial is a web nano-framework. Smaller than flask or bottle,
just one class with a few convenience methods.

 - Vial is WSGI compliant, you may use Gunicorn, cheroot or the built-in wsgiref server.
 - Can serve static files (poorly) and possibly redirect 404s to index to handle SPAs correctly
 - Router is funny

Usage
-----

Vial is under active development, functionality may change. See `demo.py`.
