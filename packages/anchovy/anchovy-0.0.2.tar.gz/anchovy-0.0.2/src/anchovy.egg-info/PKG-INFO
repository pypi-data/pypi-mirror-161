# Anchovy

Anchovy is a lightweight static site generator with a few core focuses which
differentiate it from the many other options available.

* **Minimal:** Anchovy is less than a thousand lines of code and has no
  mandatory dependencies. Plus, Anchovy can be used for real projects without
  bringing in dependencies on external executables or languages, even if you
  want to preprocess CSS.

* **Unopinionated:** Anchovy offers a set of components which can be easily
  configured to your site's exact requirements, without tediously ripping out
  or overriding entrenched behaviors. Anchovy does not assume you are building
  a blog or that you wish to design your templates in a specific way. You can
  even build things that aren't websites! Plus, Anchovy operates on files, so
  it's simple to integrate tools like imagemagick, dart-sass, or less.js if you
  need them.
