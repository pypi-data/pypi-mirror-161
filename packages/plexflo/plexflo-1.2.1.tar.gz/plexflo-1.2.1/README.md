## Plexflo

Plexflo offers a comprehensive ecosystem of tools and libraries that lets you build Deep Learning powered applications for effective management of grid with accurate forecasting and analytics.

## Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring

Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is the process of deducing/identifying appliances and their energy consumption in a household. With NILM, we enable energy disaggregation â€“ Process of decomposing power consumptions levels at appliance level from the aggregate consumption at house level.

## Plexflo's Open Source library

We have built an Open-Source library <em>datastream</em> that aids researchers and engineers to try our Deep Learning models for detection of EVs (Electric Vehicles) charging events from smart home meter data.

## Installation

```
$ pip install plexflo
```
To update plexflo to the latest version, add `--upgrade` flag to the above
commands.

## Trying out our library

For examples an how to use the library, see the [Official guide](https://docs.plexflo.com/docs/datastream-library).
