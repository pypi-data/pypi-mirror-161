  Entity:
    description: >-
      Entity is the root class of ‘core’ classes model - those that have identifiers and other general 
      metadata like labels, xrefs, urls, descriptions, etc. All core classes descend from and inherit 
      its attributes.

          The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is 
          unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different 
          system.

  ValueEntity:
    inherits: Entity
    description: >-
      ValueEntity is the root class for classes that instantiate Value Objects. ValueEntity classes
      are not extensible and MUST NOT have optional properties.
    oneOf:

  DomainEntity:

      An abstract :ref:`ValueEntity` class extended to capture specific domain entities by reference
      to an external identifier.

  ExtensibleEntity:

    description: >-
      ExtensibleEntity is the root class for classes that instantiate Extensible Objects. Extensible
      Objects are extensible using the extensions property and MAY have optional properties.

  RecordMetadata:
    inherits: ExtensibleEntity
    description: >-
      A re-usable structure that encapsulates provenance metadata that applies to a specific
      concrete record of information as encoded in a particular system, as opposed to 
      provenance of the abstract information content/knowledge the record represents.

  Extension:
    description: >-
      The Extension class provides VODs with a means to extend descriptions
      with other attributes unique to a content provider. These extensions
      are not expected to be natively understood under VRSATILE, but may be
      used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes when needed.
