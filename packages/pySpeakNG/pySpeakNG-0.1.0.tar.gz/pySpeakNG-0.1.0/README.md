## pySpeakNG
A thin wrapper around [eSpeak-NG](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng) for
off-line text-to-speech synthesis. Development is in alpha.

## Installation
Installation instructions via `pip` are coming soon, shortly after publication
of the first beta to PyPI.

## Requirements
A working installation of the
[eSpeak-NG](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng) command line utility for
Linux (and presumably for Windows, though this is not yet supported officially.)
