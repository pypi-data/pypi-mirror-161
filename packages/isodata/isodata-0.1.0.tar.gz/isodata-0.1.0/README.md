## ISO Data

`isodata` provides standardized API to access energy data to the major Independent System Operators in the United States.

It uses publically available APIs provided by the ISOs, but falls back to webscraping if an API isn't available.

## Feedback Welcome

`isodata` is under active development. If there is any particular data you would like access to, let us know.
