# Release notes (ISIS Autoreduction v21.1.1)

Interactive plotting


### Interactive plotting
The webapp can now show Plotly plots that have been saved with `to_json`.
This works similar to the static plots, but the file should end in `.json` rather than an image format.
To get one to show in the webapp simply save out the `.json` in the `output_dir` during the reduction.
