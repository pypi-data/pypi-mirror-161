# Test results and reports

As soon as you start [sending test results](../sending-data-to-launchable/) to Launchable using the Launchable CLI, you can view **test reports** in the Launchable webapp. Launchable provides a richer view into test results, helping developers triage failures and fix them more quickly.

For quick access to test results, the Launchable CLI prints out a link to this page every time you record tests results:

In addition, Launchable shows all of your test runs in one place for easy navigation. No more digging around build logs:
