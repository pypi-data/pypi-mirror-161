## Getting Started
Well, here is the beginning of a simple code that you can use no matter what
### Installation
Of course we will now install the library through a command <code>pip</code></br>
if your system is Windows
```console
$ pip install pytranslation
```
if your system is Linux
```console
pip3 install pytranslation
```
And here we finish installing the library
## Usage
Through this code and instructions, you will be able to use the library as required
```python
# Here we will call the library
# (py) Python
from pytranslation import Translation

translate = Translation()
# Through this command. You can convert from any language to the language you want
translate = translate.convert('en', 'ru', 'Welcome to USA!')
# This is here output 
print(translate)
```
You can also translate from the names of the entire language
```python
translate = translate.convert('English', 'Russian', 'Welcome to USA!')
```
Oh! also, instead of typing the language, you can learn the language automatically (this feature wotk in Google Engin, I don't know if it works with other engines)
```python
translate = translate.convert('auto', 'ru', 'Welcome to USA!')
```

Do you know that  ? Indee, you can choose another engine for translation through this
example
```python
# If you don't use a specific engin, Google Translate will be the default
translate = translate.convert('en', 'ru', 'Welcome to USA!', engine="Liber")
```
