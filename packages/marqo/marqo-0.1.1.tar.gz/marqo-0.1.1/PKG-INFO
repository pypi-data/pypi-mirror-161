        A deep-learning powered, open-source search engine which seamlessly integrates with your applications, websites, and workflow.
        
        Applications built with Marqo enjoy the following features out-of-the-box:
        
        ‚ö° **Performance**
          - Intuitive design pattern for high-performance microservices.
          - Run Marqo at scale - horizontal scalability by design.
          - Duplex streaming between client and server.
          - Async and non-blocking data processing over dynamic flows.
        
        üç≥ **Ease of use**
          - Setup in three lines.
          - Plug and play functionality with machine learning models and parsers.
          
        ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-native
          - Use Marqo in high availability with Opensearch backend.
          - Serverless deployment with Marqo cloud (coming soon!).

        ## Get started
        
        1. Marqo requires docker. To install docker go to https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
        2. Use docker to run Opensearch.
        ```bash
        docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9600:9600 -e "discovery.type=single-node" opensearchproject/opensearch:2.0.0
        ```
        3. Start indexing and searching! Try the example below.
        
        ## Simple example
        
        Let's look at a simple example below:
        
        ```python
        import marqo
        
        mq = marqo.Client(url='https://localhost:9200', main_user="admin", main_password="admin")
        
        mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
            {
                "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
                "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
            }, 
            {
                "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
                "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                               "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
                "_id": "article_591"
            }]
        )
        
        results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
            q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
        )
        ```
        
        - `mq` is the client that wraps the`marqo` API
        - `add_documents()` takes a list of documents, represented as python dicts, for indexing
        - `add_documents()` creates an index with default settings, if one does not already exist
        - You can optionally set a document's ID with the special `_id` field. Otherwise, marqo will generate one.
        
        Pretty printing `results` outputs a dict like this:
        
        
        ```python
        {
            'hits': [
                {   
                    'Title': 'Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)',
                    'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, mobility, life support, and' 
                                   'communications for astronauts',
                    '_highlights': {
                        'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, '
                                       'mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts'
                    },
                    '_id': 'article_591',
                    '_score': 1.2387788
                }, 
                {   
                    'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo',
                    'Description': "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels",
                    '_highlights': {'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo'},
                    '_id': 'e00d1a8d-894c-41a1-8e3b-d8b2a8fce12a',
                    '_score': 1.2047464
                }
            ],
            'limit': 10,
            'processingTimeMs': 49,
            'query': 'What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?'
        }
        ```
        
        - Each hit corresponds to a document that matched the search query
        - They are ordered from most to least matching
        - `limit` is the maximum number of hits to be returned. This can be set as a parameter during search
        - Each hit has a `_highlights` field. This was the part of the document that matched the query the best
        
        ## Warning
        
        Note that you should not run other applications on the Opensearch cluster as Marqo automatically changes and adapts the settings on the cluster.
        
        ## Contributors
        Marqo is a community project with the goal of making neural search accessible to the wider developer community. We are glad that you are interested in helping out! Please read [this](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started
        
        ## Dev set up
        1. Create a virtual env
        2. Install requirements from the requirements file: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
        3. Activate the virtual environment
        4. Run tests by running the tox file. CD into this dir and then run "tox"
        5. If you update dependencies, make sure to delete the .tox dir and rerun
        
        ## Merge instructions:
        1. Run the full test suite (by using the command `tox` in this dir)
        2. Merge to main
        3. If you think that the change is significant, run the large data test. 
        The large data test will 
        build Marqo from the main branch and fill indices with data. Go through and test queries 
        against this data. https://github.com/S2Search/NeuralSearchLargeDataTest
