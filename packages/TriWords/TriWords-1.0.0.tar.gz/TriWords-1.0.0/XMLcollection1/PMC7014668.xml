We assumed that infected individuals will develop symptoms, including fever, at the end of their incubation period (mean 5.2 days (Table)) and progress to more severe symptoms after a few days, resulting in hospitalisation and isolation. We also took into account that individuals may have asymptomatic (subclinical) infection that would not be detected by thermal scanning or cause them to seek medical care, although these individuals may be infectious, and that infected travellers may exhibit severe symptoms during their travel and be hospitalised upon arrival without undergoing entry screening. We then estimated the proportion of infected travellers who would be detected by exit and entry screening, develop severe symptoms during travel, or go undetected, under varying assumptions of: (i) the duration of travel; (ii) the sensitivity of exit and entry screening; (iii) the proportion of asymptomatic infections; (iv) the incubation period and (v) the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation (Table).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="file">ta.xml</infon><infon key="id">ta</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><offset>3173</offset><text>Parameter Value (baseline scenario) Source Duration of travel 12 hours Beijing - London  Sensitivity of exit screening 86% Sensitivity of infrared thermal image scanners  Sensitivity of entry screening 86% Sensitivity of infrared thermal image scanners  Proportion of asymptomatic infections undetectable by typical screening procedures 17% 1 of 6 reported asymptomatic in a 2019-nCoV family cluster  Incubation period Mean 5.2 days, variance 4.1 days Reported Gamma distributed mean, variance estimated from uncertainty interval of mean  Time from symptom onset to hospitalisation Mean 9.1 days, variance 14.7 days Reported Gamma distributed mean, variance estimated from uncertainty interval of mean  </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="file">ta.xml</infon><infon key="id">ta</infon><infon key="type">table_title_caption</infon><offset>3879</offset><text>Parameter values and assumptions for the baseline scenario estimating effectiveness of exit and entry screening at airports for detecting passengers infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4072</offset><text>We assume that the time of starting travel is randomly and uniformly distributed between the time of infection and twice the expected time to severe disease, ensuring that simulated travellers are travelling during their incubation period. However, we only consider those travellers who depart before their symptoms progress to being so severe that they would require hospital care. We simulate travellers with individual incubation period, time from onset to severe disease, flight start times and detection success at exit and entry screening according to the screening sensitivities (Figure 1). An individual will be detected at exit screening if their infection is symptomatic i.e. has detectable fever, their departure time exceeds their incubation period, and their stochastic exit screening success indicates detection. An individual will be detected at entry screening if their infection is symptomatic, their incubation period ends after their departure but before their arrival, they have not been detected at exit screening, and their entry screening result is positive despite imperfect sensitivity. Entry screening detections are further divided into detection due to severe symptoms and detection of mild symptoms via equipment such as thermal scanners.

Thermal scanning, which can identify passengers with fever (high external body temperature), allows for passengers exhibiting symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection to be tested before they board a plane. Similarly, entry screening for flights originating in the most affected regions may be under consideration at airports in regions in and outside China. We estimate that the key goal of syndromic screening at airports - to prevent infected travellers from entering countries or regions with little or no ongoing transmission - is only achievable if the rate of asymptomatic infections that are transmissible is negligible, screening sensitivity is almost perfect, and the incubation period is short. Based on early data from Li et al., 2019-nCoV appears to have a shorter incubation period than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and a higher rate of asymptomatic infections. Under generally conservative assumptions on sensitivity, we find that 46 of 100 infected travellers will enter undetected.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9841</offset><text>Entry screening is an intuitive barrier for the prevention of infected people entering a country or region. However, evidence on its effectiveness remains limited and given its lack of specificity, it generates a high overhead of screened travellers uninfected with the targeted pathogen. For example, when entry screening was implemented in Australia in response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, 1.84 million people were screened, 794 were quarantined, and no cases were confirmed. While some cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been identified through airport screening in the current outbreak, our estimates indicate that likely more infected travellers have not been detected by screening.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10527</offset><text>It is important to note that our estimates are based on a number of key assumptions that cannot yet be informed directly by evidence from the ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreak. The current outbreak has spread rapidly and early evidence suggests that the average disease severity is lower than that of SARS. This may also suggest a substantial proportion of asymptomatic cases. A recent analysis of a family transmission cluster is based on a small sample size but one in six infections was asymptomatic; this is a major impediment for the effectiveness of syndromic screening. However, if asymptomatic cases were not infectious they would not pose a risk for seeding infection chains on arrival. To allow easy adaptation of our results as new insight becomes available in the coming weeks, we developed a free interactive online tool, available at https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/traveller_screening/.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11423</offset><text>While the most up-to-date data on the incubation period or the time until recovery from 2019-nCoV infection have been used in this analysis, these figures are likely to change over time as more data become available. Unless the incubation period is only a small fraction of the duration of infection in relation to that of symptomatic disease, and fever in particular, syndromic screening is likely to detect an insufficient fraction of infected cases to prevent local infections. In addition, the sensitivity of airport screening for the detection of 2019-nCoV has not been evaluated. However, we chose conservative estimates and show that with reduced sensitivity, the effectiveness of syndromic screening would further decline.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12154</offset><text>In many international airports, information is provided to travellers from affected regions recommending action if they develop symptoms on or after arrival. Some countries, for example Japan, also require incoming passengers to complete forms detailing their past and future travel in order to aid tracing. Due to the duration of the incubation period of 2019-nCoV infection, we find that exit or entry screening at airports for initial symptoms, via thermal scanners or similar, is unlikely to prevent passage of infected travellers into new countries or regions where they may seed local transmission.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>12759</offset><text>*Erratum</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12768</offset><text>Figure 2 was replaced on 7 February 2020.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>12810</offset><text>Members of the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) nCoV working group</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>12913</offset><text>Yang Liu, Charlie Diamond, W John Edmunds, Sebastian Funk, Amy Gimma, James D Munday, Hamish Gibbs, Nikos I Bosse, Sam Abbott, Timothy W Russell, Petra Klepac, Mark Jit, Joel Hellewell.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>13099</offset><text>Conflict of interest: None declared.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>13136</offset><text>Authors' contributions: Conceptualisation: BJQ, SF, SC, RME; model formulation: SC, BJQ, SF; analysis: BJQ, SC; writing: RME, SF, SC, BJQ; app testing: RME and the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) nCoV working group.
