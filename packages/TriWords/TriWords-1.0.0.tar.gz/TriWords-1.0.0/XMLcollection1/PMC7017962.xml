Genetic sequencing of isolates obtained from patients with pneumonia identified a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the etiology. As of February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had been identified in China and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other countries, including 11 in the United States. On January 17, CDC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City. CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection. As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection. Guided by CDC criteria for the evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs), 210 symptomatic persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among these persons, 148 (70%) had travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both travel- and contact-related risks. Eleven of these persons had laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Recognizing persons at risk for 2019-nCoV is critical to identifying cases and preventing further transmission. Health care providers should remain vigilant and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices when evaluating patients for possible 2019-nCoV infection. Providers should consult with their local and state health departments when assessing not only ill travelers from 2019-nCoV-affected countries but also ill persons who have been in close contact with patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the United States.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2111</offset><text>As part of CDC's Emergency Operations Center activation, CDC personnel assist state and local health departments with the evaluation of 2019-nCoV PUIs. Public health laboratories were not yet conducting 2019-nCoV testing during the period covered by this report, while awaiting Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization for the test. (The authorization occurred on February 4*). Therefore, all testing was conducted at CDC. A call center was staffed by a team of physicians and nurses 24 hours per day. During January 17-31, criteria used to determine whether a person was considered to be a PUI included presence of fever and symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness (e.g., cough or difficulty breathing) in addition to epidemiologic risk. Epidemiologic risk factors included history of travel from Wuhan City, close contact with a patient with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, or close contact with an ill PUI. Given the evolving understanding of 2019-nCoV epidemiology, testing was recommended for some persons who did not strictly meet the PUI definition, based on clinical discretion. For clinical inquiries that resulted in 2019-nCoV testing, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing was conducted at CDC using methods developed specifically to detect 2019-nCoV.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3436</offset><text>For this report, CDC reviewed inquiries regarding potential 2019-nCoV PUIs received by CDC through January 31, 2020, from state and local health departments, health care providers, and airport health screening personnel. Information was compiled from call logs and PUI forms to assess source of inquiry, PUI demographic data (including age and sex), clinical information, epidemiologic risk factors, and 2019-nCoV test results. To allow for delays in specimen shipping and testing, data for PUIs for whom an initial inquiry was received during January 2020 were collected through February 4, 2020.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4034</offset><text>During January 2020, approximately 30 CDC physicians and nurses responded to inquiries regarding approximately 650 persons. Testing was recommended for 256 persons (Figure) across 34 jurisdictions (the jurisdictions included states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and was completed for 210 persons. Testing of PUIs was not always performed because alternative diagnoses were made, or symptoms resolved. Among inquiries resulting in testing, six (3%) persons were identified through airport screening, 178 (85%) in a health care setting, and 26 (12%) through contact tracing (Table). Among 178 persons identified in a health care setting, the type of setting was reported for 125 (70%), including 79 (63%) who were evaluated at an emergency department or hospital, 22 (18%) at a student clinic, and 24 (19%) in other outpatient care settings. A total of 115 (55%) persons tested were male, and median age was 29 years (interquartile range = 21-49 years). Seventeen (8%) were health care workers, and 48 of 129 persons with available information were reported to be college students.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="file">mm6906e1-F.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>5157</offset><text>Number of persons for whom 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) testing was recommended, by date of initial inquiry (N = 256) : United States, January 2020*,  &lt;Fig_Large&gt;&lt;/Fig_Large&gt;</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="file">mm6906e1-F.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>5342</offset><text>* Confirmed cases were reported as of January 31, 2020.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="file">mm6906e1-F.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>5398</offset><text>  Public announcements of a confirmed 2019-nCoV case in the United States were made on the following dates: Jan 21, Jan 24, Jan 26, Jan 27 (two cases), Jan 30, and Jan 31.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="file">mm6906e1-F.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="type">fig</infon><offset>5572</offset><text>The figure is a bar chart indicating the number of persons (N = 256) in the United States for whom 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) testing was recommended, by date of initial inquiry, during January 2020.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><offset>5780</offset><text>Characteristic Completed 2019-nCoV testing : No.* (%) Demographics Age group (yrs), median (IQR) 29 (21-49) &lt;5 10 (5) 5-17 8 (4) 18-49 138 (66) 50-64 46 (22) &gt;=65 4 (2) Male sex 115 (55) Clinical features Signs or symptoms Subjective fever or measured temperature &gt;=100.4 F (&gt;=38.0 C) 143 (68) Cough or shortness of breath 189 (90) Clinical Course Hospitalized 42 (20) Admitted to ICU 4 (2) Died  1 (&lt;1) Setting where patient identified Airport screening 6 (3) Health care setting 178 (85) Contact tracing  26 (12) Epidemiologic risk category Travel from China  148 (70) Close contact with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or a PUI in the United States** 42 (20) Travel from China and close contact identified   18 (9) Other risk   2 (&lt;1) </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="type">table_title_caption</infon><offset>6556</offset><text>Clinical characteristics and epidemiologic risk factors among persons tested for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection (N = 210) : United States, January 2020</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="type">table_foot</infon><offset>6724</offset><text>Abbreviations: ICU = intensive care unit; IQR = interquartile range; PUI = person under investigation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="type">table_foot</infon><offset>6833</offset><text>* Numbers might not sum to total because of missing data.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="type">table_foot</infon><offset>6891</offset><text>  For this person, testing was negative for 2019-nCoV, and an alternative cause of death was established.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="type">table_foot</infon><offset>6999</offset><text>  Additional persons who were being followed through contact tracing but initially sought treatment at a health care setting are not included in this category.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="type">table_foot</infon><offset>7160</offset><text>  Includes 113 persons who traveled from Wuhan City and 35 who traveled from areas of China outside Wuhan within 14 days of symptom onset.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="type">table_foot</infon><offset>7300</offset><text>** Includes 33 persons who were close contacts of an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient and nine who were close contacts of PUIs.
