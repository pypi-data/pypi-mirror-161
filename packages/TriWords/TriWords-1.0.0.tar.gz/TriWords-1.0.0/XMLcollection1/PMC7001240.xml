Estimated risk in Europe remains high. The United Kingdom, Germany and France are at highest risk.

The infective pathogen was later identified as a novel coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV. As at 26 January 2020, a total of 1,988 confirmed cases have been reported from China. The main affected area is in the province of Hubei, but as at 27 January 2020, confirmed cases have also been reported in 32 other provinces.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1001</offset><text>Forty-one travel-related cases were confirmed as at 27 January 2020, all coming from China. Twenty-seven cases were imported to Asia, six to North America, five to Oceania, and three to Europe. Thirty of them were exported from Wuhan. In Europe, all three cases were imported to France. They were confirmed on 24 January 2020, with travel dates on 18 January 2020 (2 cases) and 22 January 2020 (1 case). One case was confirmed in Germany on 27 January 2020 with no history of travel to China but contact with a Chinese guest visiting their company. In an effort to contain the spread of the virus, Chinese authorities enforced a travel ban in the province of Hubei starting on 23 January 2020 (3 a.m. Central European Time). This includes a complete ban on international flights.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1781</offset><text>Here we estimate the risk of importation of 2019-nCoV cases to Europe from infected areas in China by air travel.

We estimate that the risk of importation of at least one case to Europe except France and Germany is high. It is larger than 80% if 60 travel-related cases are exported from China. The three countries at highest risk are the UK, Germany, and France (confirming estimates reported by other studies), with the latter two countries already reporting cases. Delays are expected from date of importation to date of identification that may bias observations at the time of writing.
