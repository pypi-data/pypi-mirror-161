# Cambridge

Cambridge is a terminal version of Cambridge Dictionary.

The dictionary data comes from https://dictionary.cambridge.org

## Screenshots

## Why This
I'm a terminal person tired of pulling out a GUI app or browser, inputting words in the search bar, hitting the search button and then waiting for the result to render with a bunch of unnecessary static files coming along. Not only is the time taken long, but also switching apps back and forth can be annoying. So I wrote this console application with features to my satisfaction.

## Features 
1. Just `camb <word/phrase>` to look up what you need. 
2. Takes less than 2s for the first run based on my 200M bandwith, including fetching, parsing, printing, and writing cache. 
3. Less than 0.1s for the same item's later search. 
4. Only fetches the first dictionary on Cambridge, getting rid of confuses by different dictionaries
5. If not found, a list of related suggestions will be displayed.
6. `camb l` to list words and phrases you've searched successfully. 

## With `fzf`
`camb l | fzf --preview 'camb {}'`, if you've installed [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), you'll get the following magics: 
1. fuzzy finding a word from the word list & instantly previewing its meaning 
2. displaying the whole word list & instantly previewing each word meaning as you scroll through the list

3. You can also add `alias cambl="camb l | fzf --preview 'camb {}'"` in your shell config for convenience

## Installation
```python
pip install cambridge
```

## Usage
```bash
camb <word/phrase>               # search a word or phrase. e.g. camb innocuous
camb <word/phrase> -v            # search a word or phrase in verbose mode
camb l                           # list words searched successfully in alphabetical order
camb l -t                        # list words searched successfully in reverse chronological order
camb l -r                        # list 20 words from the word list randomly 
camb l -d                        # delete a word from the word list

camb <phrase with an apostrophe> # e.g. camb "a stone's throw" | camb a stone\'s throw
camb <phrase with a slash>       # e.g. camb "have your/its moments" | camb have your\/its moments
```
