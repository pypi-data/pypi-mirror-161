     <center>"By law, with the use of poison, killing, torturing, castrating, destroying, in whole or in part, all elderly and all handicapped (Wzd), all criminals (Wfz) and all psychiatric patients (WvGGZ) here in the netherlands."</center>
    <br>
    <center><b>Prosecutor. Court. <a href="reconsider.html">Reconsider OTP-CR-117/19.</b></a></center>
     <br><br>

In 2018 i informed the king of the netherlands that what he calls medicine in his "care" laws are not medicine but poison. Proof of these medicine being poison were shown to the king, who's (personal) kabinet wrote back that "the king took note of what i have written".

This makes the care laws used in the netherlands to provide care to elderly and handicapped, criminals and psychiatric patients not care laws but genocide laws with which the king is killing groups of the population by giving them poison instead of medicine in the "care" they are forced to undergo.


I :ref:`wrote <writings>` the prosecutor asking for an arrest of the king (make him stop). Prosecutor decided to call it a "no basis to proceed", it requires a reconsider of the prosecutor to get the king in his cell and his genocide, thereby, stopped.
