# Benchmarking QRC
  

This repository contains the code to analysis the role of particle statistics in Quantum Reservoir Computing.

## Installation

You can either run this code interactively with Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab (ADD LINK) or installing the latest version in your local computer by typing in terminal:

```python
pip install benchmarking_qrc
``` 
## Usage

Although, any user is welcome to contribute to the project. The main objective of this repository is to facilitated the transparency and reproducibility of scientific results. 

From your terminal it is possible to generate the results with:
```bash
cd src/python_scripts
python ./memory_capacity 4 2 "fermion" 1 ij 3000 1200 300 10 -s 1 5 -e 1
```
The cell above measures the memory capacity of a reservoir with 4 fermions. For more details please check the last section in this tutorial (ADD LINK)
