# DSpace Python REST Client Library
This client library allows Python 3 scripts (Python 2 probably compatible but not officially supported) to interact with
DSpace 7+ repositories, using the new REST API in DSpace that is used by its own user interface.

This library is a work in progress and so far offers basic create, update, retrieve functionality for
Community, Collection, Bundle, Item and Bitstream objects.

Help with extending the scope and improving the code is always welcome!

## Requirements
* Python 3.x (developed using Python 3.8.5)
* Python Requests module (see `requirements.txt`)
* Working DSpace 7 repository with an accessible REST API

## Usage
After installing dependencies, you're ready to run the script.
You can either pass the base API URL to the DSpaceClient() constructor or set them as environment variables.

## Example
See the `example.py` script for an example of community, collection, item, bundle and bitstream creation.
Just set the credentials and base URL at the top of the script to match your test system, or if you've set environment
variables, remove the arguments from the DSpaceClient() instantiation and the environment variables will be used as
defaults.

Install Requests, if not already installed: (use pyenv / virtualenv as you prefer!)
