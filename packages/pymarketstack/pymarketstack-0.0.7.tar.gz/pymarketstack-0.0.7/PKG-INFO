# pymarketstack
[![build](https://github.com/NoakPalander/pymarketstack/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NoakPalander/pymarketstack/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml)

Pymarket is a simple python library for the [Marketstack](https://marketstack.com/) API. It&rsquo;s a requirement to have a valid API token, the free version or a paid alternative, see [Pricing](https://marketstack.com/product). Needless to say, this is not an official library.

# Available features
The different features marketstack supports can be found on marketstack&rsquo;s [documentation](https://marketstack.com/documentation).

### End of Data
Gets the stock data after the market has closed.
Supports 3 alternatives:

-   All: Downloads all data.
-   Latest: Downloads the data corresponding to the last date.
-   Date: Downloads a specific range of data.

### Intraday data
Not yet implemented.

### Splits data
Not yet implemented.

### Dividends data
Not yet implemented.

### Tickers
Not yet implemented.

### Exchanges
Not yet implemented.

### Currencies
Not yet implemented.

### Timezones
Not yet implemented.

# Usage
```python
from pymarketstack import EndOfDay, download

query = EndOfDay.query(token="your api token")
data, failed = download(query, "AAPL", "XEL", ...)
```

Here the first line will just create the request with the appropriate fields, the download function will return a tuple with a Response object and a list of strings corresponding to failed tickers. The query function has several options such as the usage of HTTPS, etc.
If you want to check how much quota downloading the symbols will take, you can use the quota function as follows:

```python
from pymarketstack import EndOfDay, quota

query = EndOfDay.query(token="your api token")
q: int = quota(query, "AAPL", "XEL", ...)
```

An end of data request will return 2 things, a `Pagination` object and a list of `Data` objects. Both of which are wrapped
in a `Response` object.


### Responses
```python
class Response:
    pagination: Pagination
    data: List[Data]
```

The data field is overall the most interesting one and contains a single date of data for each ticker. The fields include things like date, symbol, open, close, high, low, among others. All the fields are listed in the [documentation.](https://marketstack.com/documentation)

In case of an error the library will raise an exception corresponding to the common API error codes.
An example API response could be:
```json
{
    "pagination": {
        "limit": 100,
        "offset": 0,
        "count": 100,
        "total": 9944
    },
    "data": [
        {
            "open": 129.8,
            "high": 133.04,
            "low": 129.47,
            "close": 132.995,
            "volume": 106686703.0,
            "adj_high": 133.04,
            "adj_low": 129.47,
            "adj_close": 132.995,
            "adj_open": 129.8,
            "adj_volume": 106686703.0,
            "split_factor": 1.0,
            "dividend": 0.0,
            "symbol": "AAPL",
            "exchange": "XNAS",
            "date": "2021-04-09T00:00:00+0000"
            },
            [...]
    ]
}
```

which would be equivalent to
```python
Response(
    pagination = Pagination(limit=100, offset=0, count=100, total=9944),
    data = [
        Data(
            open=129.8,
            high=133.04,
            low=129.47,
            close=132.995,
            volume=106686703.0,
            adj_high=133.04,
            adj_low=129.47,
            adj_close=132.995,
            adj_open=129.8,
            adj_volume=106686703.0,
            split_factor=1.0,
            dividend=0.0,
            symbol="AAPL",
            exchange="XNAS",
            date=datetime.datetime(2021, 4, 29)
        ),
        ...
    ]
)
```
due to the usage of dataclasses-json, Response, Pagination, and Data are serializable to/from dicts and json strings.
