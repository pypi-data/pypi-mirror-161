abstractNote = {Zn2B2PbO6 crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pccn space group. The structure is three-dimensional. Zn2+ is bonded to four O2- atoms to form corner-sharing ZnO4 tetrahedra. There is three shorter (1.97 Å) and one longer (2.00 Å) Zn–O bond length. B3+ is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three O2- atoms. There is one shorter (1.38 Å) and two longer (1.39 Å) B–O bond length. Pb2+ is bonded in a rectangular see-saw-like geometry to four O2- atoms. There are two shorter (2.32 Å) and two longer (2.56 Å) Pb–O bond lengths. There are three inequivalent O2- sites. In the first O2- site, O2- is bonded in a 2-coordinate geometry to one Zn2+, one B3+, and one Pb2+ atom. In the second O2- site, O2- is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to two equivalent Zn2+ and one B3+ atom. In the third O2- site, O2- is bonded in a distorted trigonal planar geometry to one Zn2+, one B3+, and one Pb2+ atom.},

abstractNote = {V2NiSe4 crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/m space group. The structure is three-dimensional. V3+ is bonded to six Se2- atoms to form distorted VSe6 octahedra that share corners with six equivalent NiSe6 octahedra, edges with six equivalent VSe6 octahedra, and a faceface with one NiSe6 octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra tilt angles range from 51–56°. There are a spread of V–Se bond distances ranging from 2.43–2.71 Å. Ni2+ is bonded to six Se2- atoms to form NiSe6 octahedra that share corners with twelve equivalent VSe6 octahedra, edges with two equivalent NiSe6 octahedra, and faces with two equivalent VSe6 octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedra tilt angles range from 51–56°. There are two shorter (2.47 Å) and four longer (2.53 Å) Ni–Se bond lengths. There are two inequivalent Se2- sites. In the first Se2- site, Se2- is bonded in a 4-coordinate geometry to three equivalent V3+ and one Ni2+ atom. In the second Se2- site, Se2- is bonded in a 5-coordinate geometry to three equivalent V3+ and two equivalent Ni2+ atoms.},
