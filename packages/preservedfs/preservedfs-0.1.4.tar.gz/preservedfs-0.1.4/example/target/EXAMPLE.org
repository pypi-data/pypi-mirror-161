#+TITLE: PreservedFS Example

* Running PreservedFS
If you have downloaded the code directly, make sure you have installed =fuse-python=
by using 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install fuse-python
#+END_SRC

Then, go to the root directory of the cloned git repository and run:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python preservedfs/preservedfs.py
#+END_SRC

* Using PreservedFS
You can then browse to the =example/mnt= folder which is the folder mounted by *PreservedFS*.

You will see a union of the content of the folders =example/target= and =example/local=.

If you modify a file within the =example/mnt= folder (such as this one =EXAMPLE.org=), the changes will be written in =example/local= and reflected in =example/mnt= but the original file will be preserved!

You can play around by creating / deleting files in =example/mnt= and see how it affects the folders =example/local= and =example/target=.
