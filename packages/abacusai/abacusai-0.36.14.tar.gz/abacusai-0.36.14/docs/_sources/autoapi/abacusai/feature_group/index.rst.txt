      Creates a new point in time feature in a feature group using another historical feature group, window spec and aggregate expression.

      We use the aggregation keys, and either the lookbackWindowSeconds or the lookbackCount values to perform the window aggregation for every row in the current feature group.
      If the window is specified in seconds, then all rows in the history table which match the aggregation keys and with historicalTimeFeature >= lookbackStartCount and < the value
      of the current rows timeFeature are considered. An option lookbackWindowLagSeconds (+ve or -ve) can be used to offset the current value of the timeFeature. If this value
      is negative, we will look at the future rows in the history table, so care must be taken to make sure that these rows are available in the online context when we are performing
      a lookup on this feature group. If window is specified in counts, then we order the historical table rows aligning by time and consider rows from the window where
      the rank order is >= lookbackCount and includes the row just prior to the current one. The lag is specified in term of positions using lookbackUntilPosition.
