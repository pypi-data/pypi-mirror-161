### DEV NOTES

For local script install, make sure to add this path in wsl

export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"


Using BumpVer to control automatic version numbers

Usage:

version_pattern = "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH"


Automatic increment:
bumpver update {--major/--minor/--patch}

Do I need -n? Otherwise I have to log into GitHub

Add --dry to see what changes to make sure everything works, check pyproject.toml to ensure each file changes properly
