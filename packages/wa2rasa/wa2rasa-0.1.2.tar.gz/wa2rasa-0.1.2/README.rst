Purpose of the Package
======================

Convert intents and entities defined in the Watson Assistant skill
object to rasa nlu.yml file.

Given how rasa works, there is no way to translate dialog flows defined
in WA into rasa stories. So this converter donâ€™t intends to take care of
dialog flows.

Installation
============

.. code:: bash

   $ pip3 install wa2rasa
