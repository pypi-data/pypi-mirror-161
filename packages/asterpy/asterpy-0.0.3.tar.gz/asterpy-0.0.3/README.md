# aster.py

Aster.py is a python implementation of the [Aster](https://github.com/Jachdich/aster-server) protocol, designed for use in bots or custom clients. The syntax is heavily inspired by [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

Currently a work in progress, does not support all of the features of Aster.
