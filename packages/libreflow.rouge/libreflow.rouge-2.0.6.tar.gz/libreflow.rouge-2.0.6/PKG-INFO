## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.6] - 2022-07-29

### Changed

#### Edition

* The user can't create a working copy if the status of the `L&S ANIMATION` task is `K APPROVED`.

#### Publication

* Publishing now updates the status of the `L&S KEY FRAME` Kitsu task if it isn't `K APPROVED`; that of the `L&S ANIMATION` task otherwise.
* The user can choose the value of the Kitsu status between `WIP` and `To check`. If `To check` is selected, the user's working copy is deleted after publication.
* The `keep_editing` and `upload_after_publish` option have been hidden and disabled.

#### Submission for validation

* Make shot and file actions to send for validation available for `working_file` files.
* A `working_file` file can't be submitted for validation if the status of the selected task isn't `H TO SEND`.
* Set the Kitsu status comment with information about the submitted take (submitter, working file, original revision, task oid).

### Removed

* The `_fix` infix in the name of the key frame revision files.

## [2.0.5.1] - 2022-07-28

### Changed

* Default Kitsu source and target statutes in action to submit the lighting scene for check have been changed to `H TO SEND` and `I Waiting For Approval` respectively.

## [2.0.5] - 2022-07-28

### Added

* An action to submit a `lighting.plas` file for validation.
* An action to submit lighting scenes of all shots ready to send in Kitsu.

#### Visible tasks

* A working site now holds a list containing the names of the tasks to display when this site is the current one, and assignation for the given tasks is enabled.

### Changed

* The publication action now provides an option to update the status of a selected Kitsu task to submit the scene for check.

## [2.0.4] - 2022-07-21

### Changed

## [2.0.1] - 2022-06-08

### Changed

* The existing types defining the main entities of the project (films, sequences, shots, tracked files and folders, revisions) have been redefined to integrate the last features provided in libreflow 2.1.0.
* Tracked files and folders are created by default with the path format specified in the contextual dictionary (in the `settings` context) of the project.

### Added
