    Parameters
    -------------------
    reference (optional): dict of name-gender data
        Each key should be a name. Each value should be a list: [# of sources, # of counts, p(gf)].
        If provided, this dictionary will be used in place of the name_data dictionary used by default.
        This option is useful in the event that one wants to combine the name_data dictionary, accessed via nqg.dump(), with additional name-gender data.
    threshold (optional): float in range [0, .49]
        Parameter controlling how informative of either gendered group a name must be to be classified.
        Names associated with p(gf) values more uncertain than this threshold are not classified.
        Technically, this value is a threshold on the following quantity: 0.5 - abs(.5 - p(gf)).
        By default this threshold is set to 0.1 meaning names with p(gf) values in the range (.1, .9) are not classified while names in the ranges [0, .1] and [.9, 1] are classified.
        This value may be set directly and the tune function can be used to help inform this choice.
        Note that calling the tune function will by default use a heuristic to update this parameter.
