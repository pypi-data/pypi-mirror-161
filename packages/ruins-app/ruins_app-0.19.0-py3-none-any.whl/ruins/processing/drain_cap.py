    """
    Find sthe maximal flow rate in a system with a pump and a canal.
    The flow through the pump is determined by the gradient from inner to outer water level and a pump function.
    The flow through the canal is determined by the gradient from the canal water level to the pump inner water level and a flow function.
    The inner water level is unknown and estimated within this function, but a lower limit can be set.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    h_tide : np.ndarray
        the outer water level at the pump
    h_store : np.ndarray
         the canal water level
    h_min : int
        the lower boundary of the inner water level
    pump_par : np.ndarray
        parameters of the pump function
    channel_par : Tuple[float, float]
        parameters of the canal flow function
    dh : int
        increment of inner water level estimation
    wind_safe : int
        gradient from canal to inner water level, which is induced by wind and therefore not contributing to flow
    gradmax :int
        maximum gradient from inner to outer water level, at which pumps shall run 

    Returns
    -------
    a_channel : np.ndarry
        the actual maximum flow through canal and pump
    h_min : float
        the estimated inner water level
    q_pump : float
         the maximum flow, which could be pumped if not limited by canals
