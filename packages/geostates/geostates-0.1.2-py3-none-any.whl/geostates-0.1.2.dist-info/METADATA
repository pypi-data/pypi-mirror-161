Geostates is a Python package for quickly plotting choropleth maps of the United States.

Installation
------------

**PyPI**

To install geostates run: ``pip install geostates``.


Dev roadmap
-----------

The current version of geostates only allows for plotting choropleth maps of the United States using a very specific
set of shapefiles. In the future, the goal is to add:

- Ability to plot United States maps with county-level data.
- Add support for Congressional Districts, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and Zip Code Areas to individual state
 plots.
- Add support for plotting categorical data for United States maps.
- Add features for plotting political science maps (ie. Electoral College maps, etc.).

How to contribute
-----------------

You can contribute to the geostates package by installing it and giving it a try. You can also file issues on the 
issue tracker or submit a pull request if you would like to make any improvements.

Acknowledgements
----------------

- This package's core functionality relies substantially on the [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) package.
- The idea to use inset axes for this package came from Cimbali. A helpful explanation on utilizing segmented
colormaps came from JohanC. As mentioned in the comments, the function for discretizing matplotlib colormaps was
inspired by an example provided in Jake VanderPlas' [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).
