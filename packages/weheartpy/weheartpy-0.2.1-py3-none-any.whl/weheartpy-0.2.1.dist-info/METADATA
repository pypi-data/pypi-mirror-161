# **weheartpy**

**A fast, reliable API client for WeHeartIt.**

![weheartpy](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1002212458502557718/1003290415329443850/PicsArt_07-31-06.47.36.jpg) 

# Description
weheartpy is an unofficial API client for [weheartit](https://weheartit.com)

[WeHeartIt](https://weheartit.com) does not have an API. So I have to make use of `BeautifulSoup`
and `requests` to do my job. The speed is optimal, it has a limitation on number of results you can retreive through one search but its functional.


# Requirements
* requires `Python 10.*` or above.
* read the requirements [here](requirements.txt)

you can easily install the packages using [pip](https://pypi.org)

# Installation
```
pip install weheartpy
```
or
```
pip install git+https://github.com/aswinnnn/weheartit.git

```

# Features
**with weheartpy, you can search for:**
* posts aka entries
* collections (including images inside them)
* users
* popular entries

I'm adding more functionalities and utilities later on, 
but this is all we got for now. 

# Usage
this is the most basic usage of the weheartpy module.

```python
# import the main class
from weheartpy import WeHeartIt

whi = WeHeartIt() # create an instance of WeHeartIt

entries = whi.popular() # returns a list of recent popular images from homepage.

for entry in entries:
	print(entry.id)
	print(entry.username)
	print(entry.image)
	print(entry.url)
```
* parameters - None

* returns - List[[Entry](weheartpy/models.py)] a list of `Entry` objects which help you access the entries easier. 
* errors - `ConnectionError`

# Posts / Entries
search for entries.
```python
entries = whi.search_entries("mean girls", sort="most_popular")
# returns a list of entries relevant to your query.

for entry in entries:
	print(entry.username, entry.image, entry.url)
```
* parameters - `query` - your search query

* returns - List[[Entry](weheartpy/models.py)] a list of `Entry` objects which help you access the entries easier. 
* errors - `ConnectionError`


# Collections

```python
# return a list of `Collection` objects resulting from the query.

from weheartpy import WeHeartIt

whi = WeHeartIt()

cocs = whi.search_collections("anime pfp")
for c in cocs:
    print(c.title, c.link)
    collection = c.get_full_collection()
    print(collection.images, collection.description)
```
* parameters - `query` aka the search term
* returns - List[[Collection](weheartpy/models.py)] Check out the documentation to see what else you can do with `Collection` objects.
* errors - `NoCollectionsFound` 

# Documentation
* check out the [documentation](https://aswinnnn.github.io/weheartpy/) for more usages. 
* If you'd like to add something or fix mistakes, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
  
# About
- more utilities might come later, depending on need and interest.
- feel free to fork, pull, and open issues! 
- currently on `v0.2`
  
# Disclaimer
- Since this makeshift API client relies on the websites elements to remain unchanged, expect this package to break easily someday. `useragent` will be supported soon.
- This package, code or software is made for educational purposes and does not intend to break any ToS of weheartit.com. The creator/maintainer of this package will not be responsible for any actions done using the code. Use with your own caution and volition.
