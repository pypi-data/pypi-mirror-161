------------------

* First release on PyPI.

0.2.0 (2019-01-15)
------------------

* Minimal functionality in place.
* Docstrings complete.

0.3.0 (2019-01-31)
------------------

0.4.0 (2019-01-31)
------------------

0.5.0 (2020-05-29)
------------------

0.6.0 (2021-02-11)
------------------

* Fix bug in listing possible endpoints
* Add some utility functionality and speed up unpacking packed time series (thank you RHL)

0.6.4 (2021-02-15)
------------------

* Fix a regression that causes an exception when the name of one column is the same as the start of the name of another column
* Add a test for the regression

0.7.0 (2021-03-24)
------------------

* Add the get_schema method to fetch metadata about topic fields
* Add a test for the schema parser

0.8.2 (2021-05-25)
------------------

* Deal gracefully with topics that have no description or units (Thanks Angelo!)
* Add a parameter to allow a time threshold when selecting top N (Thanks Michael!)

0.8.3 (2021-06-11)
------------------

* Add column specifying if a field in the schema is array-like.
* Check for both conventions indicating unitless columns when creating astropy units.

0.9.0 (2021-10-05)
------------------

* This changes the convention to using UTC as the internal representation.
  This mirrors a change in the influxDB to store index timestamps as UTC.
  There is a switch to convert the index from TAI to UTC, but the default is to assume UTC everywhere.

0.9.1 (2021-10-28)
------------------

* Fix various bugs left over from the UTC conversions.
  The most important of these is correcting how the index for packed time series is handled.
  The other is in the implementation fow how we attempt to handle legacy databases with the index still in TAI.

0.10.0 (2021-11-18)
-------------------

* Change how ports are handled.
  This forces the port to be sent with the rest of the auth information and removes the ability to pass an override port.

-------------------

* Allow astropy to raise an exception for malformed units in the topic schema.

0.11.0 (2022-05-24)
-------------------

* Updates to API calls to handle SAL 7 change to indexed component ID field.
* Add timeout option to the EFD client.
  Set the `aiohttp.client` timeout when working with chunked queries. Set a default timeout of 900 seconds.

0.12.0 (2022-07-27)
-------------------

* The auth helper can now use a path attribute to connect to an InfluxDB instance.
