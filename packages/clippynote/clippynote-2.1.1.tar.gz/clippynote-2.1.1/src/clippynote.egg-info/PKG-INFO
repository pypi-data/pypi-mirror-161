A CLI for taking notes with key value pairs that uses `.json` file to store its data. It is designed to be used in a terminal. You can use it to take notes on your projects, tasks, or anything else you want.

Also you can copy and paste the note with the `-c / --copy` option, it will use the clipboard data.

Although the package is named `clippynote`, but the CLI is using `note` as the entry point to the CLI. Why? you may ask. Well, it's because `note` is short and easier to type than `clippynote`.
