                    <p>
                        In order to reduce new data, you must have a reduction script written in python.
                        This script should be called <code>reduce.py</code> and should be placed in the
                        <code>user/scripts/autoreduction/</code>
                        directory in the ISIS data archive.
                        A full example script can be seen below:
                    </p>

                    <h4>Re-running older reductions (Stored script)</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you have a previous run through Autoreduce, you can re-run it using the
                        same script it was originally run with. This is useful if you have since made changes 
                        to the reduction script and wish to re-run the same reduction with different variables.
                        <br>
                        To do this,	select "Run with stored script" when on the re-run jobs page.
                        A reduce.py does not need to be present for this (it will simply be ignored if it is)
                    </p>

                    <h4>Imports</h4>
                    <p>
                        All your imports should be placed at the top of the file. These can include, python
                        packages, mantid packages and the <code>reduce_vars</code> we defined in the above section.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Validate</h4>
                    <p>
                        The first function you define should validate that the files and directories you
                        require exist. This should include all files and directories. If any can not be
                        found, an exception should be raised. Below is an example for reference:
                    </p>

    print("Validation successful")</code></pre>

                    <h4>Main</h4>
                    <p>
                        This function should call the validate function to check inputs and then perform
                        reduction steps. The function must take an <code>input_file</code> and <code>output_dir</code>
                        as parameters. Both arguments should be validated in the validate function.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-python">def main(input_file, output_dir):

                        configurations.

                        that takes in two arguments, <strong>data</strong> and <strong>output</strong>.
                        These are passed in a kwargs but it may be desirable for these to also be accepted from the
                        command line.

                        The reduction script should perform all operations on the provided data file and
                        save the output to the output directory provided to the script. The output will
                        be copied to the cache upon completion. If additional save locations are
                        required these can be returned as a list of system paths from the main method.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you feel your script will need to save to additional locations please
                        <a href="mailto:{{ support_email }}">Contact Us</a> to ensure the locations are accessible from
                        the Autoreduction machine.

                    <p>Plotly is slightly different from Matplotlib, but the difference is mostly in the syntax, while the fundamental features remain the same.
                    As long as Plotly successfully serialises the plot <code>to_json</code>, it should also work in the webapp.</p>
                    <p>Because Mantid integrates Matplotlib, it is <strong>not possible</strong> to plot workspaces directly into Plotly. You will have to extract the data manually via the <code>readX</code>, <code>readY</code>, and similar methods.</p>
                    <p>To avoid adding plotting code here that will get out of date, it is recommended to have a look at the <a href="https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/#scatter-and-line-plot-with-goscatter">documentation</a>.</p>

                    <p>
                        There are 2 different output structures for reduction runs:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                                <strong>Flat Output:</strong> In flat output mode all files are outputted into a flat
                                structure. This means that all runs for the same RB will be in the same folder. This
                                mode offers the most simple structure but means every subsequent rerun of a run would
                                overwrite the previous run.

                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                                <strong>Versioned output:</strong> In Versioned output mode, each run all reruns of
                                runs will be outputted into their own separate folder. For example
                                <code>RB123/1234/run-version-1</code>. This structure results in more files and folders
                                but has the benefit that every version of a reduction run will be kept.
