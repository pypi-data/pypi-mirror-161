Description: # RAPL-formula
        
        A [powerAPI](https://github.com/powerapi-ng/powerapi) formula using RAPL
        counters to provides power consumption information of each socket of the
        monitored machine.
        
        Use RAPL data collected with the
        [hwpc-sensor](https://github.com/powerapi-ng/hwpc-sensor) and convert it into
        power consumption measures (in Watt). The power consumption measures are store
        in a MongoDB database.
        
        # Quick start
        
        We detail here how to quickly start rapl-formula and connect it to a hwpc-sensor
        using a mongoDB instance.
        
        For more detail see our documentation [here](http://powerapi.org)
        
        ## Get input data
        
        You have to launch the [hwpc-sensor](https://github.com/powerapi-ng/hwpc-sensor) to
        monitor sockets. The sensor must store its data in a mongoDB database. This
        database must be accessible by the rapl_formula.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        You can pass the configuration through a file or the CLI.
        In both case the parameters to precises are the following :
        
        - `verbose` (bool)
        - `stream` (bool): If working with a sensor in real-time
        - `input`
        - `output`
        - `enable-cpu-formula` (bool): Enable CPU formula', default=True
        - `enable-dram-formula` (bool): Enable DRAM formula, default=True
        - `'cpu-rapl-ref-event` (str): RAPL event used as reference for the CPU power models, default='RAPL_ENERGY_PKG'
        - `'dram-rapl-ref-event` (str): RAPL event used as reference for the DRAM power models, default='RAPL_ENERGY_DRAM'
        - `'sensor-report-sampling-interval` (int): (for stream mode) The frequency with which measurements are made
          (in milliseconds)
