% n^2+n est pair pour tout n

% Theorem statement
For all natural numbers $n$, $n^2+n$ is even.

% Proof
We will use induction on $n$

The base case ($n=0$) is trivial

For $n=k+1$, the induction hypothesis gives us that $k^2+k$ is even.

By expansion, we can derive $(k+1)^2+(k+1) = k^2 + 3k + 2 = k^2 + k + 2(k+1)$

Therefore, $k^2+k+2(k+1)$ is even, and $n^2+n$ is even.
