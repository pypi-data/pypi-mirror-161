% n(n+1)(n+5) est divisible par 3

% Theorem statement
For all natural numbers $n$, $n(n+1)(n+5)$ is divisible by $3$.

% Proof
We will use induction on $n$

The base case ($n=0$) is trivial

For $n=k+1$, the induction hypothesis gives us that $k(k+1)(k+5)$ is divisible by $3$.

By expansion, we have $k(k+1)(k+5) = k^3 + 6k^2 + 5k$

We can also derive $(k+1)((k+1)+1)((k+1)+5) = (k+1)(k+2)(k+6) = k^3 + 9k^2 + 20k + 12$

If we split this last expression, we can show that $k^3 + 9k^2 + 20k + 12 = (k^3 + 6k^2 + 5k) + 3(k^2 + 5k + 4)$

Therefore $k^3 + 9k^2 + 20k + 12$ is divisible by $3$, and thus $n(n+1)(n+5)$ is also divisible by $3$
