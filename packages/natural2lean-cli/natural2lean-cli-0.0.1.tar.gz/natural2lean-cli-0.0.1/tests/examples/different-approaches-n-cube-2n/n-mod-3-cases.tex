% theorem statement
For any natural number $n$, $n^3 + 2n$ is divisible by $3$.

% proof
Considering the possibilities of the modulo operation, we have $n \mod 3 \in \{0, 1, 2\}$.

% 1st case : n % 3 = 0
Therefore, we have a natural number $k$ such that $n = 3k$.

Using this, we can show that $n^3 + 2n = 27k^3 + 6k = 3(9k^3+2k)$.

Therefore, $n^3 + 2n$ is divisible by $3$.

% 2st case : n % 3 = 1
For this case, we have a natural number $k$ such that $n = 3k + 1$.

By expansion, we can show that $n^3 + 2n = 27k^3 + 27k^2 + 15k + 3 = 3(9k^3 + 9k^2 + 5k + 1)$.

And we can therefore conclude that $n^3 + 2n$ is also divisible by $3$ in this case.

% 3st case : n % 3 = 2
The last case is similar, we have a natural number $k$ such that $n = 3k + 2$.

By expansion, we can show that $n^3 + 2n = 27k^3 + 54k^2 + 42k + 12 = 3(9k^3 + 18k^2 + 14k + 4)$.
