Sitemapa is a small package to reduce your work while generating sitemaps. You describe your sitemaps with JSON-structure. Sitemapa is framework agnostic and not indexing your website â€” it's just generating sitemaps from your description. Noting more. I use it to generate sitemaps for millions of URLs on my websites.
