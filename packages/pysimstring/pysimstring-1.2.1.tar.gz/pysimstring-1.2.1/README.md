# SimString Python Package

Orginal version by [chokkan](https://github.com/chokkan/simstring) and [QuickUMLS](https://github.com/Georgetown-IR-Lab/simstring).

This version removes the [libiconv](https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/) dependency
which required a conda installation before installing the simstring package on Windows.
