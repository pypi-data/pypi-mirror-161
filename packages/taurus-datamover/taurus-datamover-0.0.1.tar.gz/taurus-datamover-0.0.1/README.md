# Taurus Datamover

Python wrapper for the datamover tools that enable moving data between the [ZIH fileserver](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/dienste/service-katalog/arbeitsumgebung/datenspeicher/details) and the [taurus cluster](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/hochleistungsrechnen/hpc?set_language=en) at TU Dresden

Before you can start working on the taurus cluster, you need to file a [project request](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/hochleistungsrechnen/hpc?set_language=en#section-1). You also need a [group share](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/dienste/service-katalog/arbeitsumgebung/datenspeicher/details#section-2) on the ZIH fileserver.

## ProjectFileTransfer
If you own a project space on taurus and want to transfer files to it, you can ask [HPC support](https://tu-dresden.de/zih/hochleistungsrechnen/support) to enable a connection to your fileserver.
Afterwards, you can use [TUD ZIH datamover](https://doc.zih.tu-dresden.de/data_transfer/datamover/) to transfer files from the fileserver to the cluster.
