        Publish IPNS names.

        :param lifetime: Time duration that the record will be valid for.
        This accepts durations such as "300s", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are
        "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h". Default: 24h. Required: no.
        :param allow_offline: When offline, save the IPNS record to the the local datastore without broadcasting to the network instead of simply failing. Required: no.
        :param ttl: Time duration this record should be cached for. Uses the same syntax as the lifetime option. (caution: experimental). Required: no.
        :param key: Name of the key to be used or a valid PeerID, as listed by 'ipfs key list -l'. Default: self. Required: no.
        :param quieter: Write only final hash. Required: no.
        :param ipns_base: Encoding used for keys: Can either be a multibase encoded CID or a base58btc encoded multihash. Takes {b58mh|base36|k|base32|b...}. Default: base36. Required: no.
