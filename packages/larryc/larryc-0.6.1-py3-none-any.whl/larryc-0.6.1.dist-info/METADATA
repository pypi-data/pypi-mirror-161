Larryc is an asynchronous dictionary-search engine that runs in your terminal with a pleasing UI. It is depending on the [dictionary api](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). And, the UI is written using the [Rich framework](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).

<br>

## Motivation
First of all, nobody these days carries dictionaries. Second of all, not everyone likes to use the browser for everything. Especially me. I feel like small things like this should be done in the terminal, which is fast and straight to point. Larryc is **maybe** going to solve the *dictionary* crysis. That's what I'm calling it. 

<br>

## Installation & Usage
- Cross-platform (Python must be installed):
```bash
# Install the package (pip required).
pip install larryc

# Basic command-line usage.
python -m larryc archeology # You can use any word in place of archeology here.
```

In order to set up the development environment for this library, consider [cloning the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and installing the dependencies for it first using the commands below. The tests for this project have been written to support [pytest](https://pytest.org).
