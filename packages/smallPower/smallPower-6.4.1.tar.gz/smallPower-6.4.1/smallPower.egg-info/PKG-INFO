Description: # Smallpower 6.4
        
        ## Description
        The whole program dumps data from Beckhoff(using a PLC_configuration file .xlsx) and calculates real-time indicators(dumps them as well).
        - the dumper should be started with :
        ```
        ./bin/start_dumper_smallpower.sh
        ```
        Look at the status or kill the dumper with :
        ```
        ./bin/status_dumper_smallpower.sh
        ./bin/kill_dumper_smallpower.sh
        ```
        
        - possible to work with the beckhoff simulator:
        ```
        ./bin/start_simulator_smallpower.sh
        ```
        
        ## pre-requisites
        
        ### postgresSQL
        - postgressql server should be active running on port 5432(user:postgres,password:sylfenbdd) containing a **jules** database with a **realtimedata** table(default settings).
        - do not forget to cofnigure pg_hba.conf correctly.
        - you change password of user postgres with :
        ```shell
        alter user <postgres> password '<newpassword>';
        ```  
        
        ### Connection to the beckhoff opcua server
        - in order to be able to connect to the beckhoff for the dumping and real-time you should do the following or you have already take an existing certif/key pair:
        ```shell
        openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout <key.pem> -out <cert.pem> -days 7200 -nodes
        ```
        
        ### data acquisition
        - it uses the python package dorianUtils==6.4. Please install it with pip:
        ```
        pip install dorianUtils==6.4
        ```
        - data are dumped a in the folder ~/smallPower_daily by default.
        - to change the default settings, create a file *parameters_conf.py* in the smallpower folder which will overwrite the default parameters from smallpower/conf.py. In that case you should install the project using:
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```
        - a plc configuration file : ALPHA - BD Instrum XL_Vxxx.xlsm should be in the confFiles folder. The new version is to be put in the same folder if there are any updates.
        - conf.py has a function generate_conf_small_power to regenerate the configuration and load the new configuration file. It builds also the tag_color_code and the list of indicators.
