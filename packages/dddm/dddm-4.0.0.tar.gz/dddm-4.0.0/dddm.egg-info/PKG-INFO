        # Installation (linux)
        
        Please follow the installation
        script [here](https://github.com/JoranAngevaare/dddm/blob/master/.github/scripts/install_on_linux.sh)
        
        For running on multiple cores, I'd advise using `conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py openmpi`

        # Requirements
        
        
        - WIMP spectrum generation modules:
          - [`wimprates`](https://github.com/joranangevaare/wimprates). For generic spectra generation
          - [`verne`](https://github.com/joranangevaare/verne). For generating spectra taking into account earth shielding
          - [`darkelf`](https://github.com/JoranAngevaare/DarkELF). For Ge/Si Migdal spectra generation
        - Optimizer:
            - [`multinest`](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest). The fastest, but installation can be tricky
            - [`emcee`](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Used mostly for validation of the other methods
            - [`nestle`](http://kylebarbary.com/nestle/). Fully pythonic, works on all platforms and
            - [`ultranest`]( https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/using-ultranest.html). Still in alpha phase but has a lot of nice features
        
        # Options
        
        - Multiprocessing
        - Earth shielding integration
        - Computing cluster utilization
