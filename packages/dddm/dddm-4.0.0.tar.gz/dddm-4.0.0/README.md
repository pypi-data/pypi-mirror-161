Probing the complementarity of several in Direct Detection Dark Matter Experiments to reconstruct
Dark Matter models

# Installation (linux)

Please follow the installation
script [here](https://github.com/JoranAngevaare/dddm/blob/master/.github/scripts/install_on_linux.sh)

For running on multiple cores, I'd advise using `conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py openmpi`

# Requirements


- WIMP spectrum generation modules:
  - [`wimprates`](https://github.com/joranangevaare/wimprates). For generic spectra generation
  - [`verne`](https://github.com/joranangevaare/verne). For generating spectra taking into account earth shielding
  - [`darkelf`](https://github.com/JoranAngevaare/DarkELF). For Ge/Si Migdal spectra generation
- Optimizer:
    - [`multinest`](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest). The fastest, but installation can be tricky
    - [`emcee`](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Used mostly for validation of the other methods
    - [`nestle`](http://kylebarbary.com/nestle/). Fully pythonic, works on all platforms and
    - [`ultranest`]( https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/using-ultranest.html). Still in alpha phase but has a lot of nice features

# Options

- Multiprocessing
- Earth shielding integration
- Computing cluster utilization
