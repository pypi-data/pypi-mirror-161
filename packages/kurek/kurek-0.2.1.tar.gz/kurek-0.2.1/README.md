# kurek
**kurek** lets users download data from [zbiornik.com](https://zbiornik.com).

The script uses your private account login information to retrieve photos and
videos from profiles that you pass to it. It uses the site's API and finds
download links for media available in highest fidelity available to you.
Files are collected using *asyncio*-adjacent libraries - it's quite fast.

This project is under heavy development, but the basic functionality is already
there.

# Features
- Written in Python3
- Uses *aiohttp* and *aiofiles* libraries for fast downloads
- It provides many flags to modify its behavior. Use *-h* to see them all
- Works perfectly on Linux

# TODO
- Downloading media from Top Lists for a date in time - even those not freely
  available on the website interface
- Automatic testing
- Prepare a Docker image for ease of use
