# pescea - python interface to Escea fireplaces

This is a python interface to the [Escea range](https://escea.com/) of fireplaces.

The specifications for the interface are contained in the [included pdf](./630260_3_Escea_Fireplace_LAN_Comms_Spec.pdf).

Further information on the Escea controller's network communications can be found in [this pdf](./Escea_Controller_Network_Communications_Summary.pdf)

## Usage

This package is not a standalone application for end user implementation.

The aim of this package is to be used by software developers and integrators to implement
the Escea interface on home automation platforms (principally Home Assistant )

## Credit

The [pizone interface](https://github.com/Swamp-Ig/pizone) was used as a template and
for inspiration in developing this interface (which saved a lot of time, so thanks!)
