# EditPi

This is the new location for Planet's built-in MCPIEdit's source code. 

## Installation
#### Prequesites
- PyQt5, see further.
- Python 3
#### Actual installation
- Use `pip3 install editpi[pyqt5]`, as it installs PyQt5 through pip.
- On non-`amd64` Linux devices you will need to install the PyQt5 library through your package manager. This is because there is no compiled distribution for your architectures in the PyPI.
