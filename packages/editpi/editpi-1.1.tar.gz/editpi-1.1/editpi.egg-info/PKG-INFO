Description: # EditPi
        
        This is the new location for Planet's built-in MCPIEdit's source code. 
        
        ## Installation
        #### Prequesites
        - PyQt5, see further.
        - Python 3
        #### Actual installation
        - Use `pip3 install editpi[pyqt5]`, as it installs PyQt5 through pip.
        - On non-`amd64` Linux devices you will need to install the PyQt5 library through your package manager. This is because there is no compiled distribution for your architectures in the PyPI.
