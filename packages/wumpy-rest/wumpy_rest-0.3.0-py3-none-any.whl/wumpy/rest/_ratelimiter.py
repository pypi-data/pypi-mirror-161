    """A special type of timed semaphore.

    This is very similar to AnyIO's `Semaphore` or `CapacityLimiter`
    implementation, but adapted to work for Discord ratelimits.

    A `Ratelimit` is made up of one lock and two events, along with the
    information from the ratelimit headers. The purpose of the lock is to be
    able to queue tasks trying to acquire the ratelimit, because if one task
    needs to sleep until the next reset then all the following tasks needs to
    do so as well.

    The two events are used a bit differently, the first is used to completely
    lock the ratelimit in the case that a 429 response is received. The second
    event allows the ratelimit to notify itself once another reset is known,
    because Discord does not provide a "per" header so it cannot be calculated
    in advance.
    """

    # Previously this class had a move() feature to handle two buckets merging
    # while having multiple waiters. It introduced a lot of code complexity and
    # was only there for an extremely rare condition that required:
    # - Discord to merge two buckets
    # - There to be multiple tasks waiting on the same route and major params
    #
    # When this is not handled, the worst that can happen is an 429 response
    # from Discord, which in of itself will be handled correctly. This is not
    # the end of the day really.
