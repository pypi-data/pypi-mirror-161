    ratelimiting without adding a bunch of parameters to each request.

    It is adviced that all ratelimiters implement all of these behaviours. If

        the same name (`abort_if_ratelimited()`). It allows the user to specify
        that they wish to abort requests if they get ratelimited.

        There are two places where the ratelimiter needs to check this value:

        - Before pre-emptively waiting on a ratelimit, and...
        - Before retrying a request that failed with a `Ratelimited` exception

        Under both these circumstances, the ratelimiter should raise the
        `Ratelimited` exception which will be catched by the context manager.

    This function returns a context manager, that when entered, will abort any
    requests if they will be ratelimited. Useful for skipping somewhat
    pointless requests that you don't want to wait for.

    !!! info
        The global ratelimit of all requests is always abided. This function
        is for ignoring larger route-specific ratelimits.

    The way this is implemented is by catching the `Ratelimited` exception.
    That means that not all code inside of this context manager will run if the
    request gets ratelimited. Therefore, if you want to use the result of the
    request this code needs to be placed inside of the context manager.

    If you want to know whether the requests were aborted, you can check the
    `aborted` attribute on the context manager:

    ```python
    with abort_if_ratelimited() as abort_ratelimits:
        user = await api.fetch_user(344404945359077377)
        print(f"Found user {user['name']}#{user['discriminator]}")

    # Note that 'user' may or may not be defined here, depending on whether the
    # request was aborted or not. That's why we print inside of the context
    # manager.

    if abort_ratelimits.aborted:
        # Since the request was aborted, the above print did not get to run
        print('Skipped fetching because of ratelimits')
    ```

    For more complex situations, you can also nest this to only abort subset of
    requests at a time. This allows you to compose requests that get aborted on
    their own without aborting all requests inside of the parent.

    !!! note
        This function does not skip the ratelimiter, rather, it aborts the
        request *if* the ratelimiter wants to wait. You cannot use this to
        force requests to bypass the ratelimiter.

    Returns:
        A context manager which skips requests if they will be ratelimited.
